# facts

Rust CLI that manages `.facts` files — flat lists of atomic, validatable truth statements about a project. Serves as both specification and documentation.

Read `.facts` in the project root for the full format spec, CLI reference, and architecture.

## Commands

```sh
cargo build              # build
cargo test               # run all tests (integration + inline unit)
cargo clippy             # lint
cargo fmt --check        # check formatting
```

Single test:

```sh
cargo test test_name -- --nocapture
```

## Code style

Minimal Rust. Two dependencies: `clap` (CLI) and `anyhow` (errors). No async, no FFI, single-threaded.

```rust
fn cleanup_empty_sections(sections: &mut Vec<Section>, path: &[usize]) {
    for depth in (0..path.len()).rev() {
        let current_path = &path[..=depth];
        let section = locate::navigate_to_section(sections, current_path);
        if section.facts.is_empty() && section.children.is_empty() {
            if depth == 0 {
                sections.remove(current_path[0]);
            } else {
                let parent_path = &current_path[..current_path.len() - 1];
                let parent = locate::navigate_to_section_mut(sections, parent_path);
                parent.children.remove(current_path[depth]);
            }
        } else {
            break;
        }
    }
}
```

## Testing

All user-facing features are tested end-to-end in `tests/cli.rs`. Each test gets an isolated temp directory with a `.git` marker. Unit tests are inline in their modules.

## Releasing

1. Bump version in `Cargo.toml`
2. Commit and push
3. `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z`
4. GitHub Actions builds binaries for 5 targets and creates the release

## Fact-driven development

This project uses [facts](https://github.com/av/facts) for specification and documentation. All work flows through the fact sheet — it is the source of truth.

**Every change starts with a fact.** Facts are the spec — they define what "done" means. Code that isn't described by a fact is unverifiable and will be treated as incorrect. The skill `facts skills show facts` has the full format spec and command reference.

1. `facts list` — read the current spec to orient. Fact sheets can be large — use filters to focus: `--section "cli/init"`, `--tags "draft"`, `--file api.facts`, `--manual`. Read only the section relevant to your task, not the entire sheet.
2. `facts add` — write facts describing what should be true when done. Each fact is a testable claim. You are not ready to write code until this step is complete.
3. Implement the code to make those facts true
4. `facts check --tags "<tag>"` or `facts get <id>` — verify your changes. Never run bare `facts check` unless asked.
5. `facts edit <id> --add-tag implemented` — mark verified facts done

Step 4 only works if step 2 happened. If you skipped step 2, go back now — you cannot verify work that has no fact.

**Manual facts (`?` in check output):** these have no command, so you verify them by reading the relevant code. For each `?` fact: read what it claims, check the code, report PASS or FAIL with a one-line reason. Reporting "N manual" without verifying each one is not acceptable.

**Lifecycle:** `@draft` → `@spec` → `@implemented`

**Domain:** the `## domain` section in `.facts` defines the project's entities and relations — read it first to learn the vocabulary.

**Skills** (invoke via `facts skills show <name>`):
- `facts-refine` — sharpen `@draft` facts into `@spec` with the user
- `facts-discover` — scan the codebase and sync facts to reality (only when explicitly asked)
- `facts-implement` — implement `@spec` facts in code, verify, tag `@implemented`
